# Predicting Taxi Gratuities in NYC
<section> <h2>Overview</h2>
The goal of this project was to create multiple linear gegression and random forest model to predict high rider gratuity or not. This project utilized yellow taxi trips taken in New York City during 2017. The final random forest model performed with 86% accuracy and 72% precision determining what features were important in separating low tippers from high tippers. Based on the model, the duration, distance, and cost of the trip were most influential in determining a generous tipper (>20%) vs a non_generous one (<20%).
